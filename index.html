        <h2>About our group</h2>
        <span>Hi, we're Dungeons and Dragons players from the greater Orlando area! We use <a href="https://www.meetup.com/OrlandoDnD/" target="_blank">Meetup.com</a> to host our games.</span>
        <p>
        D&D Adventurers League is an ongoing official organized play campaign for Dungeons & Dragons®. We play at various gaming stores across Orlando!
        </p>
        
        <p>The D&D Adventurers League rules permit a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 7 players per table. It is a good idea to put yourself on the waitlist as plans could change and a spot could open up prior to the event date to which you will get notification from Meetup if it does. If you do not sign up on the event page and there are spots still available, it will be up to the DM if you are permitted to play as a walk-in right before the session starts. RSVPs open up one to two weeks prior to the event and are on a first-come, first-served basis. Currently there are four main locations where our Orlando RPG games are held; Campus Cards and Games (near UCF), Campus Cards and Games 2 (near Full Sail University), Drop Site Games (near Valencia College - West Campus), and  CoolStuffGames South Orlando (on OBT right off the 417).
        </p>
                
        <p>Adventurers League tables for our Orlando RPG group are listed by the adventure or hardcover storyline name, the adventure’s Tier level (Tier 1 is for characters levels 1 through 4, Tier 2 is levels 5 through 10, Tier 3 is levels 11 through 16, and Tier 4 is levels 17 through 20) and the recommended level range for characters, and the recommended Average Party Level (APL) the adventure was written for. </p>
            
        <h3>ALL NEW PLAYERS TO D&D ADVENTURERS LEAGUE CAN ONLY SIGN UP FOR TIER 1 ADVENTURES OR ADVENTURS THAT INCLUDE LEVEL 1 IN IT’S RECOMMENDED LEVEL RANGE AS NEW CHARACTERS CAN ONLY START OFF AT LEVEL 1.</h3>
        
        <p>As your character gains levels you will be able to participate in higher Tier adventures with it! Also note that once a character has played an adventure it cannot replay that same adventure at a later date - however your other characters can if they hadn’t already.
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h3>In order to participate in D&D Adventurers League games, you will need the following:</h3> 
        
        <ol type="1">
            <li> <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/208178/DD-Adventurers-League-Player--DM-Pack" target="_blank">D&D Adventurers League Player’s Pack (REQUIRED AND FREE)</a>; The D&D Adventurers League Player’s Pack is various PDF documents in one free download. It contains the current season’s official Player’s Guide, character sheet, Adventure Logsheet, and various helpful reference guides on the differences between Adventurers League and home games. You can use an official D&D Adventurers League character sheet in the Player's Pack or any other D&D character sheet that suits you. You’ll use the Adventure Logsheet to record each session of AL play; keeping track of your experience, treasure, and other notes. DMs might ask to see your Logsheet to make sure that your character is legal for Adventurers League play.</li><br>
            
            <li>A DCI Number (REQUIRED AND FREE); This is an official Wizards of the Coast organized play number and it is free to sign up for one. It’s obtainable using the instructions in the Adventurers League Player’s Guide (located in the Player’s Pack download above) or at public events - just ask the organizer for one the first time you play.</li><br>
           
            <li> <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules" target="_blank">The Basic Rules or the Player's Handbook (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)</a>; The Basic Rules is a PDF or web-based document and is available for free. It contains all of the basic rules of the game and you can even create a character with it. It is highly suggested to purchase the Player’s Handbook though as it contains more options then what the Basic Rules provide and can be purchased through your Friendly Local Gaming Store (FLGS) or through various online retailers such as Amazon.</li> <br> 

            <li>Lastly, there are two humorous, yet very informative, videos by Puffin Forrest you can watch to give you an idea of the differences between home games and Adventurers League and will give you a good idea of what to expect when you show up to your first Adventurers League game.</li><br>

        <p>We also have a public <a href="https://discord.gg/bssqa9q" target="_blank">Discord</a> server for Orlando RPG! When you log into the server for the first time make sure to use the “/nick” command to set your server-specific user name to your Meetup user name so it’s easier on the DMs!
